  "description": "GreenAR provides the tools needed to transform an ARKit app from a single-session, single-user experience to one which can persist between sessions and be shared between users. Methods are provided for mapping real-world spaces, serializing such mappings, and relocalizing within them on a cold start using reference points. See the example application for ideas on how to use GreenAR.",
